## 🛒 Shopping List App

### Overview

This project is a small JavaScript exercise focused on **array manipulation** and **DOM interaction**.
Users can add items to a shopping list, remove the last item, and see the list dynamically updated on the webpage.

### Features

* Add new items to a list (no duplicates)
* Remove the last item from the list
* Display the list dynamically in the browser
* Filter items using a search term (case-insensitive)

### Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript (ES6)

### How It Works

1. Enter an item in the input field.
2. Click **“Add Item”** to add it to the list.
3. Click **“Remove Last Item”** to remove the most recent item.
4. The list updates instantly on the page.

## 🧠 Reflection Questions

**1. How did array methods like push() and filter() help you manipulate data in this activity?**
They made it simple to manage the list.
`push()` added new items easily, and `filter()` helped search for specific items without manually looping through the array.

**2. What challenges did you face when trying to filter and search for items in the array?**
The main challenge was handling case sensitivity and making sure the search worked no matter how the user typed the term (uppercase or lowercase).

**3. How would you modify this code to make it more efficient or user-friendly?**
I’d add features like live search (filtering as the user types), clear buttons, and maybe local storage to save the list even after reloading the page.
